# hello-world

First attempt at GitHub:

Hello, world. Henry here...I am trying to learn GitHub because I was thrown into this environment at work? What do I want to be when I grow up? A front-end developer? Mobile developer? UI/UX developer? Who knows!?

Maybe this coursework will help decide that...only time will tell.
